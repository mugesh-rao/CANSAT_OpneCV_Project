# Cloud Image Segmentation - JIT CNASAT Workshop

The **Cloud Image Segmentation** project is focused on segmenting cloud images using **Python** and **OpenCV** for the **JIT CNASAT Workshop**. The goal of the project was to process and segment cloud images from satellite data, helping in analyzing and interpreting cloud patterns for various meteorological applications.

The project utilizes image processing techniques in Python to identify, segment, and classify cloud regions in satellite images, providing essential data for weather forecasting and climate monitoring.

## Features

- **Cloud Segmentation**: Segment cloud regions in satellite images using OpenCV.
- **Preprocessing**: Apply image preprocessing techniques such as resizing, normalization, and filtering.
- **Thresholding**: Use thresholding techniques to identify cloud regions in the image.
- **Edge Detection**: Implement edge detection methods to improve the segmentation accuracy of cloud boundaries.
- **Visualization**: Display the segmented image and highlight cloud regions for better analysis.
- **Save Results**: Save the segmented images as output files for further analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for developing the segmentation logic and running the image processing tasks.
- **OpenCV**: Open-source computer vision library used for image manipulation, thresholding, and segmentation.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical operations, used for handling arrays and matrix operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing the segmented cloud regions.
